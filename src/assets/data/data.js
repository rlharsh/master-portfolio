const aboutMe =
`In 2023, I embarked on a transformative journey to better myself and pursue my passion for technology by enrolling in a Web Application Development degree at my local College. Just a year into this journey, I've plunged into the depths of web-application development, mastering technologies like ReactJS, JavaScript, Node.js, and turning what once seemed impossible into a reality.

My current endeavor is not just about coding; it's about building software that narrows the gap between humanity and technology. Through my blog, I share insights from my software development journey, aiming to enlighten and assist fellow enthusiasts along the way.

When I'm not immersed in code, I'm likely to be found relishing retro games with my wife, sharing moments with my two cats, or indulging in continuous learning. As I look forward to joining the workforce, I'm excited to explore and contribute to innovative web solutions that make a difference.`;
